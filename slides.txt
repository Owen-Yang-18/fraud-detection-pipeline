Dataset Scale & Timeline:

17,341 total Android samples collected from December 2017 - December 2018
13,077 samples successfully analyzed dynamically
11,598 samples in final processed dataset


Data Sources: Multi-source collection approach

VirusTotal service, Contagio security blog, AMD, MalDozer
Additional datasets from recent research contributions


Malware Categories (5 distinct types):

Adware: Hidden advertising in legitimate apps, continuous pop-ups
Banking Malware: Trojan-based, mimics banking apps to steal credentials
SMS Malware: Exploits SMS services for C&C communication and data theft
Riskware: Legitimate programs exploitable by malicious users
Benign: Non-malicious applications verified through VirusTotal


Final Dataset Distribution:

Adware: 1,253 samples | Banking: 2,100 samples | SMS: 3,904 samples
Riskware: 2,546 samples | Benign: 1,795 samples


Analysis Methodology:

Dynamic Analysis: CopperDroid VMI-based system for behavior reconstruction
Static Analysis: Comprehensive feature extraction from APK files
Network Analysis: PCAP traffic capture during execution


Comprehensive Feature Sets:

470 behavioral features: System calls, binder calls, composite behaviors
139 system call features: Focused on system-level interactions
50,621 static features: Permissions, APIs, intents, services, file types, obfuscation patterns


Available Resources:

Original APK files, JSON analysis logs, structured CSV feature files
Publicly available for cybersecurity research and AI/ML applications


Key Advantages: Most comprehensive static + dynamic feature coverage compared to existing public datasets
